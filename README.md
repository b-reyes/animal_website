# Animal Website

This is my first time playing around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! I'm creating a simple website and trying to make it at least function. I couldn't think of anything better so here we are. I am cheap, so I decided to host this website using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). If you don't know what GitHub pages is, it's a wonderful way to host a website for free! I highly encourage you to try it out. To checkout my website hosted by GitHub pages, [click here](https://b-reyes.github.io/animal_website).
